I'm Hoang-Anh Nguyen Do. I am working at [FPT AI](https://ai.fpt-software.com/), under the supervision of Postdoctoral Scholar [Tan Nguyen](http://tannguyen.blogs.rice.edu/) and Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). I graduated from the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, [Ho Chi Minh City University of Education](https://hcmue.edu.vn/en/faculties/department-of-mathematics-informatics) with an Bachelor's degree.

# My work and research
My favourite topics are Visual Question Answering, Memory-augmented Neural Networks for Reasoning, Graph
Neural Networks, From System 1 Deep Learning to System 2 Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Topological Data Analysis, Continual Learning, Transformer, and Geometry and Machine Learning.
I started my research works with [Topological Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis), with advisor Prof. Bay Vo (HCMC University of Technology) in 2018. Since 2019, my focus has been on Machine Reasoning, in particular Memory Augmented Neural Networks for Reasoning. My proposal was using Structured Knowledge Base for [Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/dorarad/mac/). I also focus on dynamical structured memory for Reasoning. I have also been researching Molecular Representation Learning and Graph Neural Networks.
