I'm Hoang-Anh Nguyen Do. I am working at [FPT AI](https://ai.fpt-software.com/), under the supervision of Postdoctoral Fellow [Tan Nguyen](http://tannguyen.blogs.rice.edu/) and Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). I graduated from the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, [Ho Chi Minh City University of Education](https://hcmue.edu.vn/en/faculties/department-of-mathematics-informatics) with an Bachelor's degree.

# My work and research
My current works are making [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)) scalable in Machine Learning. In particular, I investigate new dimension reduction methods (via projections) and new sub-sampling methods (mini-batches) for Optimal Transport. On the application side, I am interested in utilizing Optimal Transport to improve generative models, Bayesian inference, domain adaptation, and other tasks that need to deal with probability measures. I am also interested in designing efficient [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) architectures.
