Hi! Iâ€™m Khai, a first-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). I graduated from  [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/) with an excellent Computer Science Bachelor's degree.
Before joining UT Austin, I was an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research, Vietnam](http://www.vinai.io) under the supervision of [Dr. Hung Bui](https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/). 
# My work and research
My current works are making [Optimal Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)) scalable in Machine Learning. In particular, I investigate new dimension reduction methods (via projections) and new sub-sampling methods (mini-batches) for Optimal Transport. On the application side, I am interested in utilizing Optimal Transport to improve generative models, Bayesian inference, domain adaptation, and other tasks that need to deal with probability measures. I am also interested in designing efficient [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) architectures.
